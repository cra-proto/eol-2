            <h2 id="h_1">Why you need a clearance certificate</h2>
            <p>Having a clearance certificate confirms that an estate of a person who died or a corporation has paid all amounts of tax, interest and penalties it owed at the time the certificate was issued.</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/legal-representative.html">legal representative</a> may apply for a clearance certificate when they need to distribute assets without the risk of being personally responsible for amounts the person who died, estate, trust or corporation might owe the CRA. Your financial institution or lawyers may also ask you for a clearance certificate.</p>
<p>Depending on your situation, you may or may not decide to apply for clearance certificate:<p>
              <details>
                 <summary>For an estate of someone who died</summary>
                 <p>You will need a clearance certificate if:</p>
                 <ul>
                   <li>you need to distribute assets of a deceased individual</li>
                   <li>the person had a GST/HST number</li>
                 </ul>

             <p>You will not be able to get a clearance certificate as long as the estate remains in debt to the CRA. Learn  about how to <a href="manage-estate-debt.html">manage an estate in debt.</a></p>

              <details>

            <p>You will need clearance certificate if:</p>

              <li>the corporation is winding up or for any other type of corporate dissolution and you are planning to distribute corporate property</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the corporation will continue operations, instead of a clearance certificate you may only require a<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/changes-your-business/comfort-letter.html"> comfort letter.</a></p>

          <h2 id="h_2">Distributing assets without a clearance certificate</h2>
          <p>If the legal representative does not get a clearance certificate before they distribute assets and there are any tax amounts owing to the CRA, they are personally liable for unpaid amounts, up the value of the amount of assets distributed.</p>


          <h2 id="h_3">When to apply for a clearance certificate</h2>
            <p>Do <strong>not</strong> submit your clearance certificate request at the same time as your returns filing. This will result in a delay of your returns assessed. <p>
          <p>A clearance certificate should be requested <b>after</b>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>all of the <a href="prepare-returns-someone-died.html">returns have been filed</a> </li>
            <li>you have received the notices of assessment from the returns</li>
            <li>any outstanding balances owing to the CRA have been paid and there are no other outstanding adjustment requests</li>

        <h2 id="h_6">Processing times</h2>
        <p>We will send the representative of the person who died an acknowledgement letter within 45 days of receiving the request for a clearance certificate.</p>
        <p>Our assessment can take up to 120 days, assuming all of the necessary documents were provided. However, in certain situations, the CRA may need to do an audit before it issues the clearance certificate.</p>
        <p>If your request is denied, you will be advised by what information is missing and what still needs to be done. You will be able to reapply for clearance certificate once you have addressed these issues.</p>
        <p>If you have not received your certificate, have been denied a certificate or a clearance certificate officer has not contacted you within 120 days, contact enquiries at: </p>
        <p>For individual (T1), or trust (T3) accounts call 1-800-959-8281</p>
        <p>For corporations (T2) or GST/HST accounts call 1-800-959-5525</p>
        <h2 id="h_7">After you receive a clearance certificate</h2>
        <p>When issuing a clearance certificate the CRA reviews all known information available to verify all balances owing have been paid.</p>
<p>Once the legal representative has received a clearance certificate, they are then able to distribute assets without the risk of being personal liable for amounts the person who died, estate, trust or corporation might owe the CRA.</p>

<h3>If new debts are discovered after a clearance certificate is issued</h3>
<p>A clearance certificate separates the personal liability of the legal representative from any newly discovered debts after the certificate has been issued. Once the legal representative has a clearance certificate, liability then rests on the estate, trust, corporation, beneficiaries, or other people who have received funds from the estate, trust, corporation, or GST/HST account.</p>
