            <h2 id="h_1">When you need a clearance certificate</h2>
            <p>A clearance certificate lets the legal representative distribute assets. Your financial institution or lawyers may also ask you for a clearance certificate, depending on your situation.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/legal-representative.html">legal representative</a> is the person who applies for the certificate.</p>
            <p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic82-6.html">IC82-6R12 Clearance Certificate</a> </p>

                <summary>For an estate of someone who died</summary>
                <p>You may need a clearance certificate if:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>you need to distribute assets of a deceased individual</li>
                  <li>the person had a GST/HST number</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may not need a clearance certificate to distribute assets if:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>you are able to keep enough assets aside to pay any amounts owing to CRA</li>
                  <li>the estate or trust continues to exist to pay income to the beneficiaries </li>
                  <li>the estate of someone who died is unable to pay debts owed to CRA</li>

            <summary>For a corporation</summary>
            <p>You may need a clearance certificate if:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the corporation is winding up or for any other type of corporate dissolution, you should get a clearance certificate before you distribute the corporate property.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may <strong>not</strong> need a clearance certificate if:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the person had a GST/HST number</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may not need a clearance certificate to distribute assets if:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the corporation’s assets and liabilities are being rolled over into another corporation and there is no other tax liability</li>
              <li>enough funds remain in the corporate account to pay amounts owing or potential amounts owing to the CRA</li>
            </ul>
          </details>

          <h2 id="h_2">What can happen if you don't get a clearance certificate</h2>
          <p>If the legal representative does not get a clearance certificate before they distribute assets and there are any amounts owing to the CRA, they are personally liable for unpaid amounts.</p>
          <p>If a certificate was obtained before distributing the estate, in rare cases, we might revoke the certificate if the legal representative provided inaccurate information as part of the application.</p>
          
          <h2 id="h_3">When to apply for a clearance certificate</h2>
          <p>A clearance certificate should be requested <b>after</b>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>all of the <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/prepare-returns-someone-died.html">returns have been filed</a> </li>
            <li>you have received the notices of assessment from the returns</li>
            <li>any outstanding balances to the CRA have been paid and there are no other outstanding adjustment requests</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For someone who has died, CRA also needs to be notified of the death.</p>
          <p>Do not submit your clearance certificate request at the same time as your returns filing. This will result in a delay of your returns assessed. <p>
