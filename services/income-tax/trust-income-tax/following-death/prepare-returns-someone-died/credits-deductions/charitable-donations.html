               <h3>How to carry back donations to the final return</h3>
               <p>Under certain conditions, a donation by the estate can be carried back to the final return of the deceased. To be eligible to carry back the donation:</p>
               <ul class="fa-ul">
                  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The estate must meet all the requirements of a <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr> except for the 36-month time limit</li>

                  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The donated property or proceeds must have been acquired by the estate on and as a consequence of the death (or property that was substituted for such property)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>If you carry back the donation to the final return, ensure that you:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Include the total donation amount in Schedule 11A of the trust return for that tax year</li>
                  <li>Subtract the amount being applied to the previous year return in line 4 of Schedule 11A</li>
                  <li>Report the amount being carried back in the final return (or other eligible tax return), generally Schedule 9 and line 34900 of the T1 return</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Make sure you include the official donation receipt with both returns.</p>
               <details>
                  <summary>Documentation if you don't have an official donation receipt</summary>
                  <p>For gifts that have not yet been received by the qualified donee, provide a copy of all of the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>the will</li>
                     <li>a letter from the estate to the charitable organization that will receive the gift, advising of the gift, a description of the property being gifted and its estimated value</li>
                     <li>a letter from the charitable organization acknowledging the gift and stating that it&nbsp;will accept the gift</li>
                     <li>a statement or letter from the legal representative of the estate stating all of the following:<ul>
                     <li>the estate is the graduated rate estate (GRE) of the deceased individual and will be designating itself as such</li>
                     <li>the estate intends to make the gift within 60 months after the date of death</li>
                     <li>the amount of the gift claimed on the final return of the deceased individual will not be claimed on any other return (of any estate of the deceased individual in any taxation year)</li>

                  <summary>Carry the donation back to a different tax year</summary>
                  <p>Subject to the same conditions, a GRE donation can alternatively be carried back to:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>an earlier taxation year of the <abbr title="graduated rate estate">GRE</abbr></li>
                     <li>the year immediately preceding the death</li>

               <p>For non-cash gifts, you must include the value of the future gift can be reasonably ascertained and supported.</li>

               <h3>Report capital gains or losses if donated after the date of death</h3>
               <p>If the estate donates property and the property's fair market value upon transfer to the qualified donee has increased or decreased since the disposition reported in the final return, the gain or loss in value will generally be recognized for income tax purposes. This applies both to Graduated Rate Estates and former Graduated Rate Estates.</p>
               <details>
                  <summary>Donating certified cultural property</summary>
                  <p>If the property is certified cultural property or ordinarily benefits from a capital gains inclusion rate of zero, see the sections called “Gifts of certified cultural property” and “Capital gains realized on gifts of certain capital property” in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p113.html">Pamphlet&nbsp;P113, Gifts and Income Tax</a>. The same treatment will apply to the capital gains on the deemed disposition of the property immediately before the individual’s death if the property donated meets both of the following conditions:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>The&nbsp;property benefits from a capital gains exemption or exclusion when donated as described in the sections of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p113.html">Pamphlet P113</a> referenced above.</li>
                     <li>The estate is a GRE and the donation is a GRE donation.</li>
                  </ul>   
               </details>
               <p>Additional special rules exist for the proceeds of disposition and cost amount of gifts of art, from the artist’s inventory, on and as a consequence of the artist’s death.</p>
               
               <h3>Claim limit on the fair market value of gifts of property</h3>
               <p>There is a claim limit to the value of property gifted in a donation if:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the donated property was acquired as part of a gifting arrangement that is a tax shelter</li>
                  <li>the property is being gifted otherwise than as a consequence of the taxpayer's death, and the property was acquired less than <strong>3</strong> years, or in some cases, less than <strong>10</strong> years, before making the gift</li>
               </ul>
               <p>For a gift of property made to a qualified donee, in these circumstances, the limit to the eligible amount of the gift that can be used in computing the donation tax credit amount is the <strong>lesser </strong>of the property's:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> otherwise determined</li>
                  <li>cost (or its <a href="#ACB">adjusted cost base</a>&nbsp;if it is capital property, or adjusted cost basis if it is a life insurance policy at the time the gift was made)</li>
               </ul>

                  <li>real property or an immovable property located in Canada</li>

                  <li>certified ecologically sensitive land including a covenant, an easement, or in the case of land in Quebec, a real servitude (or for gifts made after March 21, 2017, a personal servitude when certain conditions are met)</li>
                  <li>a share, debt obligation, or right listed on a designated stock exchange</li>

               <!-- <p>There are also special anti-avoidance rules that may apply where a taxpayer has attempted to avoid the application of the limitation rules. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p113.html"><span class="nowrap">Pamphlet P113</span>, Gifts and Income Tax</a>.</p>
               <p>If the property was acquired as part of a gifting arrangement that is a tax shelter, the eligible amount will be reported in <span class="nowrap">box 13</span> of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t5003.html"><span class="nowrap">T5003 slip</span>, Statement of Tax Shelter Information</a>.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, a capital property is&nbsp;gifted. At the time the property is gifted to a qualified donee, its <a href="#P100_8108">FMV</a> may be more than its&nbsp;<a href="#ACB">ACB</a>.</p>
               <p>When the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> is <strong>more</strong> than the <abbr title="Adjusted cost base">ACB</abbr>, you may designate an amount that is <strong>less</strong> than the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> to be the proceeds of disposition. This may allow you to reduce the capital gain otherwise calculated. If you choose to designate an amount that is less than the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> as the amount to be used as the proceeds of disposition, this amount will be used to determine&nbsp;the eligible amount of the donation. You can choose to designate an amount that is <strong>not greater than</strong> the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> and <strong>not less</strong> than the greater of:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>any <a href="#adv001">advantage</a> in respect of the gift</li>
               <li>the <abbr title="Adjusted cost base">ACB</abbr> of the property (or, where the property was depreciable property, the lesser of its <abbr title="Adjusted cost base">ACB</abbr> and the undepreciated capital cost of the class of the property), at the time you made the donation</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Treat the amount you choose as the proceeds of disposition when you calculate any capital gain.</p> -->
