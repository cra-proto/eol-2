  <p>The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-death-benefit.html">Canada Pension Plan/Quebec Pension Plan (CPP/QPP) death benefit</a> amount received is reported by the beneficiary on their T1 Income Tax and Benefit return or by the estate on a T3 Trust Income and Information return. It is <strong> not</strong> reported on the final tax return 70(1) of the person who died.</p>
  <p>Unlike a death benefit that an employer may pay to the estate or to a named beneficiary, the CPP/QPP benefit is not eligible for the $10,000 death benefit exemption.</p>

  <p>Did the <b>estate receive</b> the CPP/QPP death benefit?</p>

  </dl>
  <p>If the CPP/QPP death benefit is the only income of the estate and a T3 Trust Income Tax and Information return
 is not otherwise required to be filed, the beneficiary of the estate will receive a T4A (P) Statement of Canada Pension Plan Benefits slip.</p>
 <p>This amount is reported on directly on the beneficiary's T1 Income Tax and Benefit return.</p>

   </details>
   <details>
      <summary>Yes and it is <strong>part of other income</strong> of the estate</summary>

  <dt>Report on line</dt>
  <dd>47 <strong> or</strong> 19 of the T3 return for the year the payment was received</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>If the death benefit is <strong>payable to a beneficiary</strong> in the year, report the amount on line 47 of the T3 return and on line 926 of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3sch9.html">Schedule 9</a>. The legal representative will also need to prepare and issue a T3 slip in the beneficiary's name and the beneficiary will be required to include the amount on their T1 Income Tax and Benefit return.</p>
  <p>If the CPP/QPP death benefit is<strong> not payable to a beneficiary</strong> in the year it is received by the estate, the amount will be included in the estate’s taxable income reported on line 19 of the T3 Trust Income Tax and Information return in the year it is received by the estate and the estate will pay tax on that amount.</p>
   </details>
		    <ul></ul>
  <p>Did a <b>beneficiary receive</b> the CPP/QPP death benefit?</p>

  </dl>
  <h4>Beneficiary received the CPP/QPP death benefit through the estate</h4>
      <p>If the estate received the CPP/QPP death benefit and it was part of other income after the person died, the legal representative must issue a T3 Statement of Trust Income Allocations and Designations to the beneficiary. The beneficary will then report that on their T1 Income Tax and Benefit return, <strong>not</strong> reported as part of the final return 70(1) of the person who died. </p>
      <h4>Beneficary applied for the CPP/QPP benefit directly</h4>
      <p>If the beneficiary applied for and directly received the CPP/QPP benefit, they will receive a T4A (P) Statement of Canada Pension Plan Benefits slip and report the amount on their personal tax return, <strong>not</strong> reported as part of the final return 70(1) of the person who died.</p>
      <p>For more detailed information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/t3-return/taxation-cpp-qpp-death-benefit-amounts.html">Reporting a CPP/QPP death benefit amount</a>. </p>

  <p>The amount on the T4A (P) Statement of Canada Pension Plan Benefits slip is to be reported as part of the person who received the death benefit's T1 Income Tax and Benefit return, <strong>not</strong> as part of the final return 70(1) of the person who died.<p>

    <p>However, a death benefit will generally not be taxable if the recipient is not a beneficiary of the estate, and <strong>all</strong> of the following circumstances apply:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the taxpayer who received the death benefit paid the deceased's funeral expenses</li>
    <li>the amount of the death benefit is not more than the funeral expenses</li>
    <li>the deceased has no heirs, and there is no other property in the estate</li>
    </ul>
  </details>


               <h2 id="h-2">Death benefit from an employer</h2>
               <p>A death benefit from an employer is an amount you may receive after a person's death for their employment service. The amount typically goes to a beneficiary, but can also go to the estate. Up to $10,000 of the death benefit is exempt from being taxed.</p>

<p>Up to to $10,000 of the total of all death benefits paid (other than CPP/QPP death benefits) is not taxable and does not need to be reported. </p>

                        <p>The death benefit from an employer of the person who died is considered income after death, a T4A Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity, and Other Income is issued and a T3 Trust Income and Information Return needs to be filed.</p>
                        <p>A trust fund for beneficiaries may have also been set up by the employer and may qualify as a death benefit.</p>
                        <p>In both cases, the estate may be able to exclude up to $10,000 of the amount from income.</p>
                        <h5>Distributing to single or multiple beneficiaries</h5>
                        <p>If you distribute the total death benefit to a single beneficiary according to the provisions of the will, the beneficiary may be able to exclude up to $10,000 of the payment from income. Enter on <strong>line 935</strong>, the amount from <strong>line 926</strong> on the T3 Trust Income and Information return eligible for this exclusion.</p>

                        <p>If you distribute the total death benefit to more than one beneficiary, split the amount eligible for this exclusion among those beneficiaries. The total eligible amount that is split cannot exceed $10,000. The beneficiaries can use this information to calculate the taxable portion that they have to report on their personal tax returns.</p>

                        <p>If you exclude the eligible death benefit from the estate's income, only the taxable portion flows out to the beneficiary. Report only the taxable portion of the death benefit on line 11 of the T3 Trust Income and Information return.</p>
                        <h5>No beneficiaries receive the death benefit</h5>
                        <p>If no one other than a estate received a death benefit, report the amount that is more than $10,000 on the T3. Even if the estate did not receive all of the death benefits in one year, the total tax-free amount for all years cannot exceed $10,000. </p>
