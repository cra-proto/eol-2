		         <p>How a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) is treated at the time of the plan holder's (annuitant) death depends on whether it is unmatured or matured and if there was a survivor or beneficiary.</p> 
               <p>This amount may be partially or completely reduced by claiming the deduction.</p>
               <p>You may need to contact the deceased's financial institution or investment broker to determine which type of <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> the deceased held.</p>
