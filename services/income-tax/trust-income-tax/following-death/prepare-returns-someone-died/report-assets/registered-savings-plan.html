		         <p>How a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) is treated at the time of the plan holder's (annuitant) death depends on whether it is unmatured or matured and if there was a survivor or beneficiary.</p>
                <p>You may need to contact the financial institution or investment broker of the person who died to determine which type of <abbr title="Registered Retirement Savings Plan">RRSP</abbr> they held.</p>
