However, if the CPP death benefit is payable to&nbsp;a beneficiary of the estate in the year that it was received by the estate, the estate is entitled to deduct the amount from its income. In this case a T3 slip will be issued in the beneficiary's name and the beneficiary will be required to include the amount on line 13000 of their T1 Income Tax and Benefit return.

               <p>A CPP or QPP death benefit will generally not be taxable where the recipient deals at arm's length with the estate (is not the beneficiary of the estate) and the benefit is received in the following circumstances:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the amount is received by a taxpayer who paid the deceased's funeral expenses</li>

                  <p>When an amount is considered to have been distributed to an estate from a foreign retirement arrangement according to the laws of the country where the arrangement was established, the payment is also deemed received by the estate for tax purposes in Canada. In this case, you must include the amount, in Canadian funds, on line 2.</p>
