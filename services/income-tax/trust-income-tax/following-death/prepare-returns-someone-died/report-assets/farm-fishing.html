               <h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
               <ul>
                  <li><a href="#h-1">Farm or fishing income</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#h-2">Farm or fishing property and equipment transfers to a child</a></li>

               </ul>
               
               <h2 id="h-1">Farm or fishing income</h2>
               <p>Farm or fishing income received from <span class="nowrap">January 1</span> to the date of death is generally reported as part of your self-employment income on the final return on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/self-employment-income-lines-13499-14299-gross-income-lines-13500-14300-net-income.html"><span class="nowrap">lines 13499&nbsp;</span>to 14300</a>.</p>
               <p>However, if farm or fishing income is earned after the death, it is considered income of the estate, and must be reported on line 7 of the T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return.</p>
               <p>If you file an optional return for rights or things 70(2) and you use the cash method, you must include income from harvested crops or livestock in the 70(2). Otherwise, you can include it in the 70(1) final return.</p>
               <p>Unharvested crops can be optionally included in the final return. If you choose not to report unharvested crop in the final return, it will instead be income of the beneficiary when harvested.</p>


               <h2 id="h-2">Farm or fishing property and equipment transfers to a child</h2>
               <p>For qualified farm or fishing property or equipment transferred to a child, you may be able to use a special amount for the deemed proceeds to defer capital gains to the beneficiary.</p>
               <h3>How to apply the special amount</h3>
               <p>The special amount is any amount, chosen by the tax filer, to be included instead of the fair market value in Column 2 (Proceeds of disposition) of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s3.html">Schedule 3</a> when calculating the capital gains for the property.</p>
               <p>When you use this special amount, the deceased can reduce their capital gain, recapture of capital cost allowance, or terminal loss. However, the transfer postpones any gain, recapture, or terminal loss to the date the beneficiary disposes of the property.</p>
               <h3>What is considered Qualified Farm and Fishing Property</h3>
               <p>Only certain farm or fishing properties qualify for the transfer:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Farm property includes land and depreciable property of a prescribed class used for farming.</li>
                  <li>Fishing property includes land and depreciable property of a prescribed class used for fishing.</li>
               </ul>
               <h3>Who qualifies as a recipient child</h3>
               <p>To qualify as a child, the child must be one of the following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the deceased's natural or adopted child</li>
                  <li>the child of the deceased's spouse or common-law partner</li>
                  <li>the deceased's grandchild or great-grandchild</li>
                  <li>a person who, while under the age of 19, was in the deceased's custody and control and was wholly dependent on the deceased for support</li>
                  <li>the deceased's child's spouse or common-law partner</li>
               </ul>

               <h3>Conditions to qualify</h3>
               <p>To use the special amount for the deemed proceeds, all of the following conditions have to be met:</p>
              
               <ul class="checkbox-lg checkbox-zebra">
                  <li class="checkbox">
                      <input type="checkbox" id="eg1" class="action-checkbox cb-dmm">
                      <label for="eg1">The farm or fishing property is used principally in a farming or fishing business carried on in Canada</label>
                  </li>
                  <li class="checkbox">
                     <input type="checkbox" id="eg2" class="action-checkbox cb-dmm">
                     <label for="eg2">The child was a resident of Canada right before the deceased's death</label>
                 </li>
                 <li class="checkbox">
                     <input type="checkbox" id="eg3" class="action-checkbox cb-dmm">
                     <label for="eg3">The farm or fishing property becomes locked-in for the child no later than 36 months after the date of death. If you need more time to meet this condition, you can make a written request to the director at your tax services office before the end of the 36-month period</label>
                  </li>
                  <li class="checkbox">
                     <input type="checkbox" id="eg4" class="action-checkbox cb-dmm">
                     <label for="eg4">The deceased, the deceased's spouse or common-law partner, or any child or parent of the deceased was using the farm or fishing property principally for farming, fishing, or a combination of both on a regular and ongoing basis, before the deceased's death</label>
                  </li>
               </ul>

               <p>The rollover provisions available for farm property also apply to land and depreciable property used mainly in a woodlot farming business. They apply where the deceased, the deceased's spouse or common-law partner, or any of the deceased's children was engaged in the woodlot operation as required by a prescribed forest management plan in respect of the woodlot. These provisions apply to transfers of property that occur after December 10, 2001. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it373r2-consolid.html">IT373R2-CONSOLID, Woodlots</a>, or contact the CRA at 1-800-959-5525.</p>
               <p>You may also be able to use a special amount for the deemed proceeds when a share of the capital stock of a family farm corporation or an interest in a family farm partnership is transferred to a child. For details, see Interpretation Bulletin <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it349r3.html">IT349R3, Intergenerational Transfers of Farm Property on Death</a>.</p>

               <h2 id="h-3">Capital gains deduction on Qualified Farm and Fishing Property</h2>
               <p>If you have capital gains on Qualified Farm and Fishing Property, you may be eligible for the capital gains deduction up to your lifetime capital gains limit.</p>

               <h2 id="h-4">Apply any remaining restricted farm losses</h2>
               <p>If the deceased has any remaining restricted farm losses carried forward, they can apply them, without the usual limit against gains from their farm property, in their final return.</p>
