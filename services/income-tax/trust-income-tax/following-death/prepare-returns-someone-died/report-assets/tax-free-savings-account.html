               <p> In general, you do not need to report <abbr title="Tax Free Savings Account">TFSA</abbr> amounts as income on the final return or any optional returns.</p>
               <p>Any reporting and tax implications will depend on the deceased’s type of TFSA, the beneficiaries, and if any income was earned after the date of death.</p>
               <p>You may need to contact your financial institution or investment broker to determine which type of TFSA the deceased held.</p>

               <p>Depending on who receives the TFSA after the death, there will be different tax implications. Determining the type of beneficiary is the first important step and can be affected by:<p>
		    <ul>
			    <li>designations in the deceased holder's TFSA contract</li>
			    <li>the terms of the deceased holder's will (if there was one)</li>
			    <li>provincial or territorial succession legislation</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>If there is <b>no successor holder or designated beneficiary</b> in the TFSA contract or will, the TFSA property is directed to the deceased holder's estate and distributed in accordance with the terms of the will.</p>

               <!-- <p>If the TFSA account is rolled over to the spouse or common-law partner (survivor) named and documented by the deceased, then it will continue to be tax-free.</p>

               <h3 id="h-2">Successor holder</h3>	 -->
               <p>If the TFSA is <b>rolled over</b> to the spouse or common-law partner (survivor), it will continue as a Tax-Free Savings Account under the successor holder.</p>
               <p>Its value, both at the date of the original holder’s death and any income earned after that date, have <b>no tax implications</b> and <b>does not need to be reported</b>.</p> 
               <p>This applies for all 3 types of TFSA accounts:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>deposit</li>
                  <li>annuity contract</li>
                  <li>trust arrangement</li>	   
               </ul>
               <p>If the successor holder already has their own TFSA, they would be considered the holder of 2 separate accounts if they choose not to consolidate them.</p>
               <p>When the successor holder has ownership, they can make tax free withdrawals and new contributions, depending on their own unused TFSA contribution room. They could also transfer part of the value from one account to the other (a qualifying transfer) and it would not affect available TFSA contribution room. </p>
               <p>A survivor may also designate a successor holder.</p>

There was no excess TFSA amount in her account. In her TFSA contract, she had named Martin as the sole beneficiary. Her estate was settled on June 7, 2021. By that time, $200 in additional income had been earned and the full amount of $11,200 was paid to Martin.</p>
                           <p>The value of Martin's late mother's TFSA as of the date of her death — $11,000, is not taxable. The income earned after the date of her death, $200, is taxable to Martin.

Martin can contribute any of the amounts he receives to his own TFSA as long as he has unused TFSA contribution room available.</p>

                  <p>If at the time of death, there is an excess TFSA amount in the deceased holder's TFSA, a tax of 1% per-month applies on the highest excess amount, for each month in which the excess stays in the TFSA, up to and including the month of death.</p>
                  <p>In these cases the legal representative must file 2 forms:</p>

                  <p>If that contribution creates an excess TFSA amount in the successor holder's TFSA, they will be subject to the tax of 1% per-month on the highest amount for each month they have an excess contribution.</p>

                           <p>Jamal is 43 years of age and a Canadian resident. He opened his TFSA in 2009 and made the maximum contributions in each year. In 2020, Jamal made the following transactions during the year:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>contribution on January 6            $5,000</li>
                              <li>contribution on March 10             $1,000</li>
                              <li>contribution on June 3               $2,700</li>
                              <li>withdrawal on October 2              $800</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>Jamal's contribution room for 2020 was $6,000. The first contribution that created the excess TFSA amount was the $2,700 contribution on June 3rd. As of that date, his total contributions in 2020 were $8,700 ($5,000 + $1,000 + $2,700). This means that as of June 3, he had an excess amount in his TFSA of $2,700 ($8,700 of total contributions minus $6,000 of contribution room).</p>
                           <p>Jamal had to pay a tax on his excess contributions. This tax was 1% of the highest excess TFSA amount in each month and applies until Jamal either withdraws the entire excess amount or until he becomes entitled to enough unused TFSA contribution room to absorb the excess.</p>
                           <p>In this example, Jamal's tax was $173 for 2020, calculated as follows:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>highest excess TFSA amount per month for January to May was $0. No tax is payable for those months</li>
                              <li>highest excess TFSA amount per month for June to October was $2,700. Tax of 1% per month on the highest excess amount was $135 ($2,700 × 1% × 5 months)</li>
                              <li>highest excess TFSA amount per month for November and December was $1,900. Tax of 1% per month on the excess amount was $38 ($1,900 × 1% × 2 months)</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>Although Jamal withdrew $800 in October, the tax was calculated based on the highest excess TFSA amount in each month. The highest excess TFSA amount in October was still $2,700.</p>
                           <p>For the months of November and December, Jamal still had an excess TFSA amount, but because of the withdrawal he made, his remaining excess TFSA amount for those last two months was $1,900 (the prior excess amount of $2,700 less the withdrawal of $800).</p>
                           <p>Therefore, in total for 2020, his tax was $173 ($135 for June to October + $38 for November to December).</p>
                           <p>At the beginning of 2021, Jamal's TFSA contribution room was $4,100 which is calculated as follows:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>Jamal's 2020 and 2021 TFSA limits ($6,000 + $6,000)</li>
                              <li>less Jamal's contributions in 2020 ($8,700)</li>
                              <li>plus Jamal's withdrawals from the TFSA in 2020 ($800)</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>The tax of 1% per month will continue to apply for each month that the excess TFSA amount stays in the TFSA. It will continue to apply until whichever of the following happens first:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>the entire excess amount is withdrawn for eligible individuals</li>
                              <li>the entire excess TFSA amount is absorbed by additions to their unused TFSA contribution room in the following years</li>
                           </ul>
                        </details>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
	 <p class="h4">Exempt contribution</p>
<p>If designated as a beneficiary, the survivor has the option to contribute and designate all or a portion of a survivor payment as an exempt contribution to their own TFSA, without affecting their own unused TFSA contribution room.</p>

                           <summary>Example of using the beneficiary's contribution room to offset an excess amount</summary>
                           <p>Miriam and Pauline were a married couple. Each had available TFSA contribution room of $6,000 at the beginning of 2021. Miriam initially contributed $6,000 to her TFSA, and Pauline contributed $1,500 to hers. On June 12, 2021, Miriam contributed an additional $2,000 to her TFSA, bringing her total contributions for 2021 to $8,000.</p>
                           <p>As Miriam only had contribution room of $6,000 for 2021, she had an excess TFSA amount of $2,000. Miriam passed away on September 18, 2021, and the value of her TFSA on that date was $8,000. Miriam had named Pauline as the successor holder of her TFSA if she dies. As Pauline meets all the conditions to be considered a successor holder, she becomes the holder of the TFSA from September 18, 2021.</p>
                           <p>Since an excess TFSA amount remained in Miriam's TFSA at the time of her death, Pauline is deemed to have made, as of October 1, 2021, a $2,000 contribution to her TFSA (which is the excess amount in Miriam's TFSA). As Pauline had only previously contributed $1,500 to her own TFSA, she still had unused TFSA contribution room for 2021 of $4,500. As a result, the $2,000 deemed contribution does not create an excess TFSA amount in her account.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, there are no tax consequences to Pauline based on this deemed contribution. Her unused contribution room for the rest of 2021 is $2,500. However, the legal representative of Miriam's estate must file Form RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return, and Form RC243-SCH-A, Schedule A – Excess TFSA Amounts, for the 2021 tax year reporting the excess in Miriam's TFSA for the period from June up to and including September 2021.</p>
