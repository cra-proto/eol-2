<p>All amounts the annuitant received from the RRIF in the year of death will have to be reported on the annuitant’s final return 70(1). A T4RIF slip is issued in the name of the annuitant for the year of death and will also show any other amounts the annuitant received in the year.</p>

			<h3>Value of the RRIF on the date of death and rollovers to a spouse or common-law partner</h3>

  <details>
    <summary>What qualifies as a designated benefit</summary>
    <p>Amounts transferred from the RRIF to a qualifying survivor, up to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the fair market value of the RRSP on the day the annuitant died</li>
      <li>generally, income earned in the RRSP from the day after the annuitant died to the date the RRSP property is distributed</li>

    <p>If these amounts are paid to the annuitant's estate, they will qualify as a refund of premiums if <strong>both</strong> of the following conditions are met:</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>there is a qualifying survivor who is a beneficiary of the annuitant's estate</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>the annuitant's legal representative and the qualifying survivor jointly file <a href="">Form T1090, Death of a RRIF Annuitant- Designated Benefit or Joint Designation on the Death of a PRPP Member</a>, to designate all or part of the amounts paid to the estate as a refund of premiums received by the qualifying survivor</li>

  <details>
    <summary>Which children qualify as <strong>financially dependent</strong></summary>
    <p>A child or grandchild of an annuitant, where before the annuitant's death, were living with them <strong>and</strong> met <strong>1</strong> of the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>net income for the previous year (line 23600 of income tax return) was less than the basic personal amount (line 30000 of income tax return) for that previous year</li>
      <li>financial independence is due to a mental or physical infirmity and your net income for the previous year was equal to or less than the basic personal amount, <strong>plus</strong> the disability amount (line 31600 of income tax return) for that previous year</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <p>The reduction, which is determined by filling out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4178/death-a-rrif-annuitant.html#chart2">Chart 2</a>, allows for a redistribution of the annuitant's income to the qualifying survivor who actually received it. This redistribution of income allows the deceased annuitant and the qualifying survivor to pay the least amount of tax the law allows.</p>
  <p>When a qualifying survivor includes a designated benefit into income, they can defer paying tax on the amount by transferring it to an RRSP, PRPP, SPP, RRIF, Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) or to an institution to buy an eligible annuity.</p>

  </ul>
  <p><strong>The transfer must be completed in the year the designated benefit is received or within 60 days after the end of the year.</strong></p>
  <p>If the qualifying survivor is 71 in the year the designated benefit is received, the transfer to an RRSP must be completed by December 31 of that year.</p>
  <p>The issuer who receives the transferred funds will issue a receipt to the qualifying survivor. The qualifying survivor can use the receipt to claim a deduction on their T1 Income Tax and Benefit return for the year the refund of premiums was received.</p>
