               <p>Houses, valuable belongings, like artwork, collections or jewelry, as well as investments like mutual funds or cryptocurrency owned by someone who dies are taxable in the final return 70(1). This is called deemed disposition, since the CRA considered someone who died to have sold the belongings (even they didn't) when they die.</p>
               <p>Only the increase in value since they were purchased or acquired (capital gain) is taxable.  This means that any difference in its value since it was purchased is considered income that needs to be reported in the final return 70(1) after the person dies.</p>
               <p>Although some properties like a primary residence are exempt from capital gains, you still need to attach a statement to declare the primary residence.</p>

                </dl>
               <p>If there is no spousal rollover, the CRA considers that a person who died has disposed of all capital property right before death. The CRA calls this a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/definitions-what-when-someone-died.html#disposition">deemed disposition</a>.</p>
               <p>You must calculate capital gains on belongings, property and investments for deemed disposition on death.</p>
               <p>A capital gain or loss for deemed disposition at death is calculated as:</p>

                  </ul>

                  <p>For each real property you sold in 2021 that includes land and a building, you must:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>determine how much of the selling price relates to the land and how much is for the building</li>
                     <li>report the sale of your land and building separately on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s3.html"><span class="nowrap">Schedule 3</span></a></li>

                  <h3>Recapture of capital cost allowance and terminal loss on rental property</h3>
                  <p>Rental properties are considered depreciable property (capital property used to earn income from a business or property) and might have additional amounts to report for any recapture of capital cost allowance or terminal loss.

	       	  </ul>
		  <p>Generally, you cannot claim a loss on personal-use property or on listed personal property.</p>

                  <summary>Property used to earn income from business (depreciable)</summary>
                  <p>Capital gains on depreciable property are reported like other types of <a href="#real-estate">depreciable real estate and land</a> even if they are business property such as machinery or equipment.</p>

                  <h3 id="ucc">Recapture of capital cost allowance and terminal loss</h3>
                  <p>For depreciable property, in addition to a capital gain, there can also be a recapture of capital cost allowance or a terminal loss.</p>
                  <p>In addition to calculating capital gains, you might need to calculate a Undepreciated Capital Cost (UCC) when you file a final return 70(1) if Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) was claimed in any previous year tax returns on that property.</p>
                  <p>You will need to compare the value of the property that CCA was claimed for in previous tax years with the value of the property upon the date of death.</p>
                  <p>This might result in either:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>A <strong>recapture of CCA</strong> goes on Line 9947 that you must repay the CRA, if the value of the property did not depreciate as much as you claimed for</li>
                     <li>A <strong>terminal loss</strong> amount that goes on Line 9948 that you can claim as part of the final return 70(1)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If you are reporting a recapture of CCA or terminal loss for a <strong>rental property</strong>:</p>

                     <p>The principal residence can be any of the following types of housing units:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>a house</li>
                        <li>a cottage</li>

                     </ul>
                     <p>A property qualifies as a principal residence for any year if it meets <strong>all</strong> of the following <span class="nowrap"><strong>four</strong> conditions:</span></p>
                     <ul class="fa-ul">
                        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>It is a housing unit, a leasehold interest in a housing unit, or a share of the capital stock of a co-operative housing corporation acquired only to get the right to inhabit a housing unit owned by that corporation</li>
                        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The deceased owned the property alone or jointly with another person</li>
                        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The deceased, or their current or former spouse or common-law partner, or any of their children lived in it at some time during the year</li>

                     </ul>
                     <p>The land on which the home is located can be part of the principal residence. Usually, the amount of land that you can consider as part of the principal residence is limited to half of a hectare (<span class="nowrap">1.24 acres)</span>. However, if you can show that the deceased needed more land to use and enjoy their home, you can consider more than this amount as part of the principal residence. For example, this may happen if the minimum lot size imposed by a municipality at the time the deceased bought the property is larger than half of a hectare.</p>

                     <summary>Maintaining a principal residence status after the date of death</summary>
                     <p>Generally, a principal residence <strong>no longer qualifies</strong> as a principal residence after the date of death.</p>
                     <p>The beneficiary of the estate might need to take into account capital gains from the date of death in future returns.</p>
                     <p>However, in rare circumstances, a property might qualify as the principal residence of a trust. Refer to 2.66.1 of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/folio-3-family-unit-issues/income-tax-folio-s1-f3-c2-principal-residence.html">Income Tax Folio S1-F3-C2, Principal Residence</a>.</p>

                     </ul>
                     <p>Instead, the spouse or common-law partner will need to make the principal residence designation and report any dispositions and capital gains or losses at the earlier of the time of actual disposition or death of the surviving spouse.</p>
                     <p>A record should be kept of the years for which the deceased individual would have been eligible to make a principal residence designation for the particular property.</p>

                  <p>When you sell personal-use property, such as cars and boats, in most cases you do not end up with a capital gain. This is because this type of property usually does not increase in value over the years. As a result, you may end up with a loss. Although you have to report any gain on the sale of personal-use property, generally you are not allowed to claim a loss.</p>

               <p>When property is sold, sometimes some of the proceeds are not payable until after the year of sale. Usually, a person can deduct from income the part of the proceeds that are not payable until a later year. This is called a reserve.</p>
               <p>You can have reserves both on capital gains as well as <a href="employment-income.html#h-2">self-employment income</a>.</p>
               <h3>Determine if the deceased had reserves that need to be reported</h3>
               <p>You can generally see amounts of reserves claimed in prior years by reviewing prior year Notices of Assessment. This can be done in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a>.</p>
