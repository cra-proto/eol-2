                  <p>For depreciable property (usually capital property used to earn income from a business or property), in addition to a capital gain, there can also be a recapture of capital cost allowance or a terminal loss.</p>

                     <p>In addition to calculating capital gains, you might need to calculate a Undepreciated Capital Cost (UCC) when you file a final return if you claimed a Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) in any previous year tax returns on that property.</p>
                     <p>You will need to compare the value of the property you claimed CCA for in previous tax years with the value of the property upon at the date of death.</p>
                     <p>This might result in either:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>recaptured CCA</strong> amount that goes on Line 9947 that you must repay the CRA, if the value of the property did not depreciate as much as you claimed for</li>
                        <li>A <strong>terminal loss</strong> amount that goes on Line 9948 that you can claim as part of the final return</li>
                     </ul>

                     <p>Where the principal residence is transferred to the deceased’s spouse, common-law partner, or testamentary spousal or common-law partner trust (under the conditions described in the next section), the CRA does not require you to make a principal residence designation for the period before death. Instead, the disposition must be reported and the designation may be made by the surviving spouse, common-law partner, or the trust at the earlier of the time of actual disposition or death of the surviving spouse.</p>
                     <p>A record should be kept of the years for which the deceased individual would have been eligible to make a principal residence designation for the particular property.</p>

                  <p>When you sell personal-use property, such as cars and boats, in most cases you do not end up with a capital gain. This is because this type of property usually does not increase in value over the years. As a result, you may end up with a loss. Although you have to report any gain on the sale of personal-use property, generally you are not allowed to claim a loss.</p>

               <h2 id="h-4">Reduce taxable income with net capital losses</h2>
               <p>Unlike in other years, net capital losses in the final return can also be applied to reduce other sources of taxable income. Refer to <a href="../credits-deductions/capital-losses.html">Net capital losses</a> to find out how to claim them in the final return.</p>

               <h2 id="h-5">Reserves in the year of death</h2>
               <p>You can have reserves both on capital gains as well as <a href="employment-income.html#h-2">self-employment income</a>. You can generally see amounts of reserves claimed in prior years by reviewing prior year Notices of Assessment. This can be done in Represent a Client.</p>
               <h3>What is a reserve</h3>
               <p>When property is sold, sometimes some of the proceeds are not payable until after the year of sale. Usually, a person can deduct from income the part of the proceeds that are not payable until a later year. This is called a reserve.</p>
               <h3 id="reserve-into-income">Reserves claimed in year prior to death</h3>
               <p>Reserves claimed in the year prior to the deceased's death must be included in income on the final return, unless a joint election is filed on Form T2069.</p>
               <p>Complete Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2017.html">T2017 Summary of Reserves on Dispositions of Capital Property</a> (even if it's for a reserve on self-employment income)</p>
               <p>You will have to enter zero for the current yera amount of reserve for dispositions on lines 66840 or 66844 (section A), line 66850 (section B), line 66920 (section C) and line 66990 (section D), unless a reserve is being claimed in the year of death with the joint election in form T2069.</p>
               <h3 id="reserve-election">Eligible reserves in year of death</h3>
               <p>In the final tax return, you will not usually be able to deduct income from the reserve (amounts from a sale that will only be received in a future tax year).</p>
               <p>However, there is an exception where you may claim the reserve in the final return. This is the case if a transfer to a spouse or common-law partner, or spousal or common-law partner trust, of the right to receive the proceeds of disposition or the income owing. When this happens, the legal representative and the beneficiary can choose to claim a reserve on the deceased's return.</p>
               <p>To do this, you must meet the following conditions</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the deceased was a resident of Canada on the date of death</li>
                  <li>the right to receive the proceeds of disposition or the income owing is transferred to the deceased's spouse or common-law partner, or to a spousal or common-law partner trust</li>
                  <li>if a transfer to a spouse or common-law partner, that person also has to have been a resident of Canada right before the deceased's death</li>
                  <li>if a transfer to a spousal or common-law partner trust, the trust has to be resident in Canada right after the proceeds or income become locked-in for the trust</li>
               </ul>
               <p>To make the joint election, complete <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2069.html"><span class="nowrap">Form T2069</span>, Election in Respect of Amounts Not Deductible as Reserves for the Year of Death</a>, and attach a copy to the deceased's return.</p>

               <!-- <p class="small"><strong>T3 trust income tax return</strong></p> -->
               <p>If any property, investments or belongings are sold <strong>after the date of death</strong>, including the principal residence, before being passed onto a beneficiary, you must report the capital gain in line 1 of a T3 Trust Tax and Information Return for the estate.</p>
               <p>The capital gain on the sale generally is the difference between the sale price and the fair market value (plus costs related to the disposition, if any) that you reported for the property, on the final return.</p>
