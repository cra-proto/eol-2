               <h3>Report income from a RRIF</h3>
               <p>RRIF payments the deceased received from <span class="nowrap">January 1</span> to the date of death go on <strong><span class="nowrap">line 11500</span></strong> if any of the following apply:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the deceased was 65 or older</li>
                  <li>the deceased was under 65 and received the RRIF payments due to the death of their spouse or common-law partner</li>
               </ul>
               <p>If neither of the above conditions apply, income from an RRIF should be reported on <strong><span class="nowrap">line 13000</span></strong>.</p>

               <p class="h4">Did the annuitant make a written election in the RRIF contract or in the will to have the <abbr title="registered retirement income fund">RRIF</abbr> payments continue to be paid to&nbsp;their spouse or common-law partner after death?</p>
               <details>
                  <summary>yes - elected to continue payments to a spouse or common-law partner</summary>
                  <p>The spouse or common-law partner will become the annuitant and will start to get the <abbr title="registered retirement income fund">RRIF</abbr> payments as the new annuitant.</p>
                  
                  <h3>Receive a T4RIF slip</h3>
                  <p>A <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4rif.html">T4RIF slip</a> will <strong>not</strong> be issued in the deceased annuitant's name for the fair market value (FMV) of the property at the time of death if <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions are met:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>All of the property held by the <abbr title="registered retirement income fund">RRIF</abbr> is to be paid to the surviving spouse or common-law partner (as specified in the <abbr title="registered retirement income fund">RRIF</abbr> contract or the will).</li>

                     <li>All the <abbr title="registered retirement income fund">RRIF</abbr> property is distributed <strong>before</strong> the end of the year following the year of death.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In this case, the T4RIF slip will instead be issued to the surviving spouse or common-law partner and has to report the payment on their return. They are also eligible to claim a deduction equal to the amount directly transferred.</p>

                  <summary>no - transfer to another beneficiary or the estate</summary>
                  <p>The CRA&nbsp;considers that the deceased received, immediately before death, an amount equal to the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> of the plan at the time of death. The <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> of the property is shown in <span class="nowrap">box 18</span> of the T4RIF slip issued in the deceased's name. Include this amount in the deceased's income for the year of death. However, you may be able to reduce the amount you include in income. For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4178.html">Information Sheet RC4178, Death of a RRIF Annuitant or a PRPP Member</a>, and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4040.html"><span class="nowrap">Guide T4040</span>, RRSPs and Other Registered Plans for Retirement</a>.</p>

                  <p class="h4">Did the value of the registered account increase or decrease between the date of death and when it was paid to a beneficiary?</p>
                  <details>
                     <summary>yes - increased in value</summary>
                     <p>Sometimes there is an <strong>increase</strong> in the value of a <abbr title="registered retirement income fund">RRIF</abbr> between the date of death and the date of final distribution to the beneficiary or estate. Generally, this amount has to be included in the income of the beneficiary or the estate for the year it is received. A T4RIF slip will be issued for this amount. For more information, see <span class="nowrap">Chart 7</span> - Amounts from a deceased annuitant's <abbr title="registered retirement income fund">RRIF</abbr>, in <span class="nowrap">Chapter 5</span> of <span class="nowrap">Guide T4040</span>, RRSPs and Other Registered Plans for Retirement.</p>

                     <summary>yes - decreased in value</summary>
                     <p>Sometimes, the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> of the property of a <abbr title="registered retirement income fund">RRIF </abbr><strong>decreases</strong> between the date of death and the date of final distribution to the beneficiary or the estate. If the total of all distributions from the <abbr title="registered retirement income fund">RRIF</abbr> is less than the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> of the property that was included in the deceased annuitant's income for the year of death, the deceased's legal representative can request that the difference be deducted on the deceased's final return. Generally, for the deduction to be allowed, the final distribution must occur by the end of the year that follows the year of death.
