	<p>It has not yet started to pay the retirement income to the annuitant.</p>

               <h2 id="h-1">Unmatured RRSP</h2>
   <p>The CRA considers the deceased annuitant to have recieved, immediately before death, an amount equal to the fair market value (FMV) of all property held in the unmatured plan at the time of death. This amount, and any other amount the annuitant received from the RRSP during the year, have to be reported on their Income Tax and Benefit Return for the year they died.</p>
	      <p>For more information, see <mark>Information Sheet RC4177, Death of an RRSP Annuitant, </mark> and <mark>Guide T4040, RRSPs and Other Registered Plans for Retirement.</mark></p>	  
	     
	      <h3>Transfer to the surviving spouse or common-law partner</h3>
	      <p>The CRA considers the deceased to have <b>not</b> received the amount, if <b>both</b> the:</p>
	        <ul class="fa-ul">
		      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>spouse or common-law partner is named as sole beneficiary of the RRSP contract, <b>and</b></li>
		      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>RRSP property is transferred, by December 31 of the year following the year of death, directly into a regitered plan (RRSP, PRPP SPP, or RRIF) in which the spouse or common-law partner is the annuitant.</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p></p>
	      <p>If both of these conditions are met, the spouse or common-law partner will receive a <b>T4RSP</b> slip in their name, with an amount in <b>box 18</b>. This amount needs to be reported on <b>line 12900</b> of their Income tax return for the year the transfer was made, but with an offsetting deduction.</p>
		
	      <h4>Claiming the deduction</h4>
<p>If the property was directly transferred to the spouse or common-law partner’s RRSP, they can claim a deduction on <b>line 20800</b> of their Income tax and benefit return.</p>
<p>If the amount was transferred to their RRIF, or transferred to an issuer to buy annuity, claim a deduction equal to the amount transferred, on <b>line 23200</b> of their Income tax and benefit return.</p> 	      
	      
	      <h3>Paid to the beneficiary or estate</h3>
	      <p>At the time of the annuitant’s death, the FMV of all property held in the unmatured plan is included in their income for the year of death. The <b>T4RSP</b> slip will be issued in the name of the deceased annuitant with an amount in <b>box 34</b>, and their income has to be reported on their final Income tax and benefit return. 
	      <p>When the beneficiary receives income earned in the RRSP <b>after</b> the annuitant dies, a <b>T4RSP</b> slip is issued in their name, with an amount shown in <b>box 28</b>. This amount is to be reported by the beneficiary on their Income tax and benefit return.
	      <p> When the estate receives income earned in the RRSP <b>after</b> the annuitant dies, a <b>T4RSP</b> slip is issued in their name, with an amount shown in <b>box 28</b>. This amount is to be reported by the estate.  
	      
	      <p></p> 
	   
	 <p>The amount reported on the deceased annuitant's final income tax return might be reduced if an amount is paid from the unmatured RRSP to either you or the estate of which you are the beneficiary. At the time of death, you must be either:</p>
	      <li>the spouse or common-law partner of the annuitant </li>
	      <li>a financially dependant child or grandchild of the annuitant</li>
