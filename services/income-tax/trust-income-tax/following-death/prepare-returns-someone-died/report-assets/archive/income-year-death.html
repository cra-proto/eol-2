               <p>The types of income (lines 10100 to 14600) are the same on the final personal income tax return and the 3 optional returns.</p>
               <p>You may choose to report all income in the personal income tax return, but if you choose to file one of the optional returns, you must include all relevant income in that optional return.</p>

               <h3>Income to report in a T3</h3>
               <p>Depending on the income the person who died received after death, you might be <strong>required</strong> to file a T3 trust income tax return in addition to the personal income tax return.</p>

However, if the CPP death benefit is payable to&nbsp;a beneficiary of the estate in the year that it was received by the estate, the estate is entitled to deduct the amount from its income. In this case a T3 slip will be issued in the beneficiary's name and the beneficiary will be required to include the amount on line 13000 of their T1 return. The&nbsp;estate&nbsp;does not have the option to&nbsp;elect to have the benefit taxed in the estate if&nbsp;the estate otherwise has taxable income.</p>
                                 <p>Where the CPP or QPP death benefit is the only income of the estate and a T3 return is not otherwise required to be filed, the death benefit can be reported directly on line 13000 of the T1 return of the beneficiary.</p>
                                 <p>A CPP or QPP death benefit will generally not be taxable where the recipient deals at arm's length with the estate (is not the beneficiary of the estate) and the benefit is received in the following circumstances:</p>

                                    <li>the amount does not exceed the actual funeral expenses</li>

                                 <p>A death benefit is an amount received after a person's death for that person's employment service. It is shown in box 106<strong> </strong>of the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4a-slip.html">T4A slip</a> or box 26<strong> </strong>of the <span class="nowrap"><a class="nowrap" href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3.html">T3 slip</a></span>. A death benefit payable in respect of the deceased person is not reported on the final return for the deceased; rather, it is income of the estate or the beneficiary that receives it. Up to&nbsp;$10,000 of the total of all death benefits paid may not be taxable. For more information, see <span class="nowrap"><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-13000-other-income/line-13000-death-benefits-other-than-canada-quebec-pension-plan-death-benefits.html">line 13000 - Death benefits</a></span> or Interpretation Bulletin <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it508r.html">IT508R, Death Benefits</a>.</p>

                                 <p>When a person dies, they may have a RRIF. Depending on the situation, the amount you include in the deceased's income can vary.</p>
                                 <p>If the deceased received payments from a RRIF for the period from January 1 to the date of death, report that income on the final return.

In all other cases, report the RRIF income on line 13000.</p>
                                 <p>If the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/definitions-what-when-someone-died.html#annuitant">annuitant</a> made a written election in the RRIF contract or in the will to have the RRIF payments continue to be paid to their spouse or common-law partner after death, that person becomes the annuitant and will start to get the RRIF payments as the new annuitant.</p>
                                 <p>If the annuitant did not elect in writing to have the RRIF payments continue to be paid to their spouse or common-law partner, that person can still become the annuitant of the RRIF after the annuitant's death. This is the case if the legal representative consents to the deceased's spouse or common-law partner becoming the annuitant, and the RRIF carrier agrees to continue the payments under the deceased annuitant's RRIF to the surviving spouse or common-law partner.</p>
                                 <p>A <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4rif.html">T4RIF slip</a> will not be issued in the deceased annuitant's name for the fair market value (FMV) of the property at the time of death if <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions are met:</p>
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>All of the property held by the RRIF is to be paid to the surviving spouse or common-law partner (as specified in the RRIF contract)</li>
                                    <li>The <strong>entire</strong> eligible amount of the designated benefit is directly transferred to the surviving spouse's or common-law partner's RRIF, RRSP, or to an issuer to buy an eligible annuity for the surviving spouse or common-law partner</li>
                                    <li>All the RRIF property is distributed <strong>before</strong> the end of the year following the year of death</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <p>In this case, the surviving spouse or common-law partner will receive a T4RIF slip, has to report the payment on their return, and is eligible to claim a deduction equal to the amount directly transferred.</p>
                                 <p>For all other situations, the CRA considers that the deceased received, immediately before death, an amount equal to the FMV of the plan at the time of death. The FMV of the property is shown in box 18<strong> </strong>of the T4RIF slip issued in the deceased's name. Include this amount in the deceased's income for the year of death. However, you may be able to reduce the amount you include in income. For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4178.html">Information Sheet RC4178, Death of a RRIF Annuitant or a PRPP Member</a>, and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4040.html"><span class="nowrap">Guide&nbsp;T4040</span>, RRSPs and Other Registered Plans for Retirement</a>.</p>
                                 <p>Sometimes there is an <strong>increase</strong> in the value of a RRIF between the date of death and the date of final distribution to the beneficiary or estate. Generally, this amount has to be included in the income of the beneficiary or the estate for the year it is received. A T4RIF slip will be issued for this amount. For more information, see <span class="nowrap">Chart&nbsp;7</span> - Amounts from a deceased annuitant's RRIF, in <span class="nowrap"><span class="nowrap">Chapter&nbsp;5</span></span> of <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4040.html"><span class="nowrap">Guide&nbsp;T4040</span>, RRSPs and Other Registered Plans for Retirement</a>.<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-130-other-income.html"></a></p>
                                 <p>Sometimes, the FMV of the property of a RRIF <strong>decreases</strong> between the date of death and the date of final distribution to the beneficiary or the estate. If the total of all distributions from the RRIF is less than the FMV of the property that was included in the deceased annuitant's income for the year of death, the deceased's legal representative can request that the difference between the FMV and the total of all distributions be deducted on the deceased's final return. Generally, for the deduction to be allowed, the final distribution must occur by the end of the year that follows the year of death.

                                 <p><strong>Reserves in the year of death</strong><br>
                                 Sometimes, when a property is sold, some of the proceeds are not payable until after the year of sale. Similarly, a self-employed person may have amounts that they will receive in a later year for work done this year. An example is for work in progress.</p>
                                 <p>Usually, a person can deduct from income the part of the proceeds that are not payable until a later year. This is called a reserve.</p>
                                 <p>In most cases, you cannot deduct a reserve in the year of death. However, there may be a transfer to a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/definitions-what-when-someone-died.html#spouse">spouse</a> or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/what-when-someone-died/definitions-what-when-someone-died.html#common">common-law partner</a>, or spousal or common-law partner trust, of the right to receive the proceeds of disposition or the income owing. When this happens, the legal representative and the beneficiary can choose to claim a reserve on the deceased's return. To do this, complete <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2069.html"><span class="nowrap">Form T2069</span>, Election in Respect of Amounts Not Deductible as Reserves for the Year of Death</a>, and attach a copy to the deceased's return.</p>
