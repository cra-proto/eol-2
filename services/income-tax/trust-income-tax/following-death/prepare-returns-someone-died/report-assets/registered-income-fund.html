		    <p>If the deceased was 65 or older, or if the deceased was under 65 and received the RRIF payments due to the death of their spouse or common-law partner, see Line 11500 - Other pensions or superannuation. </p>

   <summary>Example scenario</summary>
   <p>Sarah was born on July 14, 1951. She died on December 10, 2019 at the age of 68. When she died the FMV of her trusteed RRIF was $150,000. The FMV of the RRIF on December 31, 2019, was $160,000. The distribution of the RRIF property was delayed until 2021.</p>
	  <p>The RRIF contract designated Sarah’s husband, Dan, as the sole beneficiary of the RRIF. On June 30, 2021, he received $165,000 from the RRIF carrier.</p>
	  <p>Dan, who is also the legal representative of Sarah’s estate, received the two following slips from the RRIF carrier:</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>a T4RIF slip for 2021 issued in his name, showing $10,000 in box 16 and $5,000 in boxes 22 and 36</li>
		  <li>a T4RIF slip for 2019 issued in Sarah's name, showing $150,000 in box 18. </li>
		  <p>(Although Dan is the sole beneficiary of the RRIF, the slip was issued to Sarah because she did not meet the 2 conditions.)</li>
	  </ul>
	 <p></p>
	 
		  <p>Had Sarah not died, the minimum payment under the RRIF for 2021 would have been $7,272.73. Dan decides that it would be beneficial to ask for a reduction to the amount Sarah is considered to have received from her RRIF. This would allow him to shift some of her income onto his income tax and benefit return.</p>
	  <p>After filling out Chart 2, Dan decides to claim a $130,000 reduction. This reduces the amount reported on line 13000 of Sarah’s 2019 income tax and benefit return to $20,000 ($150,000 – $130,000). Because the FMV of the RRIF at the time of death was included in Sarah’s income for 2019, Dan has to write a letter to request an adjustment to that year’s return. Dan has to report $145,000 ($130,000 + $10,000 + $5,000) on line 11500 of his 2021 income tax and benefit return.</p>
	  <p>To minimize his 2021 taxes, Dan decides to transfer the eligible part of his designated benefit to his RRIF. The amount that qualifies as a designated benefit is $140,000 ($145,000 – $5,000). Dan fills out Chart 3, and determines that he can transfer $132,734 to his RRIF. He claims a $132,734 deduction on line 23200 of his 2020 income tax and benefit return.</p>
