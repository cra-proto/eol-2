               <h2 id="h-1">When to report income on a T1 or a T3</h2>
               <p>The representative of someone who died will almost always need to file at least one T1 final return on behalf of the deceased. This reports any income and increases in value of belongings and property up until the date of death.</p>
               <p>After someone has died, their belongings, property, assets and liabilities become an estate, which may continue to earn income, reported by a representative on a T3 return, for subsequent years after the death, until the estate is fully distributed to beneficiaries.</p>
               
               <ul class="cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-md list-unstyled">

                     <h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Income before date of death<span class="wb-inv">: Option 1 </span></h4>
                     <p>If a deceased person received income between <strong><span class="nowrap">January 1</span> and the date of death</strong>, it may be reported on a <strong>final personal income tax return 70(1)</strong>.</p>
                     <p>However, you may choose to report certain types of eligible income that would otherwise go on the final return on an <strong>optional return</strong>.</p>

                     <p>If income is earned after the date of death, it is considered income of the deceased's estate and must be reported on a <strong>T3 Trust Income and Information Return</strong>.</p>
                     <p>If the estate continues beyond the year of death, you will need to continue filing T3 returns for estate income in subsequent years.</p>
                     <p>You might not need to file a T3 return if the only income after death can be reported by a beneficiary. For example, the <a href="report-assets/death-benefits.html">CPP Death Benefit can be reported on the beneficiary's return</a> instead of a T3.</p>

               <!-- <h3 id="h-1a">Apply for a T3 number</h3>
               <p>The legal representative or the authorized representative of the estate can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/t3-return/application-trust-account-number-overview.html">apply for a T3 number</a> before filing the first T3.</p> -->

               <h2 id="h-2">Income eligible to report on an optional return</h2>
               <p>Although you are not required to file any of the optional returns, you may reduce or eliminate tax that you would otherwise have to pay for the person who died if you do so.</p>
               <p>If you choose to file any of the optional returns, report all income that is eligible to be included in that optional return in the optional return instead of the final return.</p>
               <p>The optional returns use the same T1 return form as the final return, and have the <strong>same income line numbers</strong> as the final return. <a href="file-returns.html">Learn how to file the optional returns</a>.</p>
               <p>The difference is that you can <strong>only</strong> report income from specific sources and time periods in the optional returns. They are as follows:</p>
               <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                  <dt>Return for rights or things 70(2)</dt>
                  <dd>
                     <p>You can only report income that was received <strong>after death</strong> that, had the person not died, would have been included in their usual income tax return. This does not include capital gains.</p>
