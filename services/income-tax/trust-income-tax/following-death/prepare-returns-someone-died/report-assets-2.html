                        <summary>What is an estate</summary>
                        <p>After someone has died, their belongings, property, assets and liabilities are called an estate. Estates of someone who died generally are designated as a Graduated Rate Estate (GRE).</p>
                        <p>An estate will continue to exist and require T3 returns for any income it earns until it is fully distributed to beneficiaries.</p>
                        <p class="h3">Graduated Rate Estate (GRE)</p>
                        <p>A Graduated Rate Estate is an estate that arose on and as a consequence of an individual’s death, if that time is no more than 36 months after the death of the individual, and the estate is at that time a testamentary trust that meets all of the following conditions:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>The estate designates itself as the person who died's GRE in its T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return (T3 Return) for its first taxation year.</li>
                           <li>No other estate designates itself as the GRE of the person who died.</li>
                           <li>The estate must include the person who died’s social insurance number in its T3 return of income for each taxation year of the estate that ends after 2015 during the 36-month period after the death of the individual.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="h3">Benefits of a Graduated Rate Estate</p>
                        <p>A Graduated Rate Estate has the following benefits:</p>
                        <ol>
                           <li>Income earned by a GRE is taxed at the same <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/frequently-asked-questions-individuals/canadian-income-tax-rates-individuals-current-previous-years.html#federal">graduated tax rates as individual taxpayers</a></li>
                           <li>Tax credits resulting from <a href="file:///Users/ligustrina/Documents%20(unshared)/GitHub/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/prepare-returns-someone-died/credits-deductions/charitable-donations.html#h-2">charitable donations made from a GRE after the death or in the will</a> can be carried back to previous GRE tax years or to the final return</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="h3">Other types of testamentary trusts</p>
                        <p>After 3 years, or if there are other reasons the estate is not designated a GRE, the estate will become a different type of testamentary trust.</p>

                     <p>If the estate continues beyond the year of death, you will need to continue filing T3 returns for estate income in subsequent years.</p>
                     <p>You might not need to file a T3 return if the only income after death can be reported by a beneficiary. For example, the <a href="report-assets/death-benefits.html">CPP Death Benefit can be reported on the beneficiary's return</a> instead of a T3.</p>

               <p>Although you are not required to file any of the optional returns, you may reduce or eliminate tax that you would otherwise have to pay for the person who died if you do so.</p>
               <p>If you choose to file any of the optional returns, report all income that is eligible to be included in that optional return in the optional return instead of the final return.</p>
               <p>The optional returns use the same T1 return form as the final return, and have the <strong>same income line numbers</strong> as the final return. <a href="file-returns.html">Learn how to file the optional returns</a>.</p>
               <p>The difference is that you can <strong>only</strong> report income from specific sources and time periods in the optional returns. They are as follows:</p>
               <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                  <dt>Return for rights or things 70(2)</dt>
                  <dd>
                     <p>You can only report income that was received <strong>after death</strong> that, had the person not died, would have been included in their usual income tax return. This does not include capital gains.</p>
