        <h2 id="h_1">Determine who is representing the person who died</h2>
        <p>When someone dies, a representative is responsible for the adminstration of the estate of the person who died. The CRA requires that the representative file tax returns and resolves any balances owing of the person's account.</p>

        <!-- The representative of the person who died is determined if there is a will or no will.</p>-->
        <h3>Types of representatives</h3>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
          <dt>Legal representative</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The legal representative is typically the executor named in the will who will be handling the estate. The will provides instruction if there are more than one executor named and all other matters of the estate.</p>
            <p>The estate is the value of the financial assets, such as property and investments, and financial liabilities, such as balances owing to the CRA, of the person who died.</p>
            <p>In Québec, you are the legal representative if you are the <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/citizens/your-situation/liquidators-of-a-succession-steps-to-follow-after-a-death/">liquidator</a> of the estate and may have additional administrative duties.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Authorized representative</dt>
          <dd id="accountant">
            <p>The legal representative may also choose to appoint one or more authorized representatives to manage the tax information on their behalf.</p>
            <p>An authorized representive is someone who can view, get information about and update the tax information for individuals or businesses. This is typically an accountant or a lawyer who would need access to the tax information.</p>
            <p>For additional information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/overview.html">authorize a representative.</a></p>
            <details>
              <summary>If the person who died previously had authorized representatives</summary>
              <p>If the person who died had authorized representatives for their tax accounts while they were alive, those authorized representatives will continue to be authorized on the account until a legal representative requests their removal. This can be done by online, by phone or fax or by mail.</p>
              <h4>Online</h4>
              <p>You can remove an authorized representative using <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client.</a></p>
              <h4>By phone or fax</h4>
              <p>Contact the CRA by phone at 1-800-959-8281 or by fax at #-###-###-####.</p>
              <h4>By mail</h4>
              <p>By letter or fill in the form send to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">mailing address of a tax centre.</a></p>
            </details>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3 id="h1_1a">Check if there is a will</h3>
        <p>The will is typically where you will find information about who will represent the person who died and instructions on what to do with the estate.</p>
        <details>
          <summary>Yes, there is a will with a named executor</summary>
          <p>If you are the executor of a will, you are the legal representative of the person who died and responsible for the adminstration of the estate. In some cases, a court document may also be issued appointing an executor.</p>
          <p>You will need to provide a copy of the will or court document to the CRA to show that you are the legal representative.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>No, there is not a will or a named executor</summary>
          <p>If a person dies without a will (intestate), or an executor has not been named in a will, certain individuals can apply to adminster the estate. Check with <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/estate-planning/resources-estate-law.html">estate law of provincial or terriortial government</a> of the residence of the person who died for more information.</p>
          <p>If there is no court-appointed representive or you are waiting for an appointment, you can request to be appointed as a representative for CRA matters using form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc552.html">RC552 Appointing a Representative for a Deceased Person.</a> </p>
          <p>Once your request has been approved, you will be authorized as a representative who can view, get information about and update the tax information for the person who died. This approval is for CRA purposes only and not for other adminstrative responsibilities outside the CRA.</p>
        </details>

        <h2 id="h_2">Responsibilities of the legal representative</h2>
        <p>The legal representative is responsible for administration of the financial assets and liabilities of the person who died.</p>
        <p>This means the legal representative can be held personally liable for outstanding tax balances owing, up the value of the distribution from the estate, if the assets have been distributed without getting a <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/clearance-certificate.html">clearance certificate.</a></p>

        <p>As the legal representative, you need to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>make sure <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/notify-government-death.html">the CRA has been notified of the death</a></li>
          <li>provide the CRA with any requested documentation
            <ul>
              <li>make sure tax returns are filed for the person who died:
                <ul>
                  <li>any <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/prepare-returns-someone-died.html">returns for the year the person died</a></li>
                  <li>any <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/t3-return.html">T3 Trust Income Tax and Information returns</a>, if required</li>
                  <li>any returns for previous years that the person who died did not file</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>confirm the estate resolved all outstanding balances owing to the CRA</li>
            <li><a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/eol/services/income-tax/trust-income-tax/following-death/clearance-certificate.html">apply for a clearance certificate</a>, as needed, before distributing any assets of the estate</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The social insurance number (SIN) of the person who died must be provided with any request or documents you are sending to the CRA.</p>
        <p>If the person who died was a resident of Québec, you may have additional responsibilities with Revenu Québec. Visit Revenu Québec's <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/citizens/your-situation/liquidators-of-a-succession-steps-to-follow-after-a-death/">steps to follow after a death</a> for information.</p>
        <h2 id="h_3">Confirm the legal representative with the CRA</h2>
        <h3>What documents you need to submit</h3>
        <p>As the legal representative, you need to submit documents to the CRA to confirm that you are the legal representative and provide updated contact information of the estate:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a copy of the death certificate, or a funeral director's statement of death</li>
          <li>a complete copy of the will or other legal document, such as grant of probate or letters of administration showing that you are the legal representative</li>
          <li>the current mailing address of the estate</li>
          <li>a completed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4111/request-canada-revenue-agency-update-records.html">Request for the Canada Revenue Agency to Update Records form</a></li>
          <li>a letter requesting if you need <a href="h_4">access to tax records for someone who died</a></li>
        </ul>
