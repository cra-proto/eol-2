        <h2 id="h_1">Determine who is representing the person who died</h2>
        <p>When someone dies, a representative is responsible for the adminstration of the estate of the person who died. The CRA requires that the representative file tax returns and resolves any balances owing of the person's account.</p>

        <!-- The representative of the person who died is determined if there is a will or no will.</p>-->
        <h3 id="h_1a">Types of representatives</h3>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
          <dt>Legal representative</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The legal representative is typically the executor named in the will who will be handling the estate. The will provides instruction if there are more than one executor named and all other matters of the estate.</p>
            <p>The estate is the value of the financial assets, such as property and investments, and financial liabilities, such as balances owing to the CRA, of the person who died.</p>
            <p>In Québec, you are the legal representative if you are the <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/citizens/your-situation/liquidators-of-a-succession-steps-to-follow-after-a-death/">liquidator</a> of the estate and may have additional administrative duties.</p>

          <dt>Authorized representative</dt>
          <dd id="accountant">
            <p>The legal representative may also choose to appoint one or more authorized representatives to manage the tax information on their behalf.</p>
            <p>An authorized representive is someone who can view, get information about and update the tax information for individuals or businesses. This is typically an accountant or a lawyer who would need access to the tax information.</p>

              <p>If the person who died had authorized representatives for their tax accounts while they were alive, those authorized representatives will <strong>continue to be authorized</strong> on the account until a legal representative requests their removal.</p>
              <p>If they are no longer a representative of the deceased, the legal representative may <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/cancel.html">cancel authorization for a representative</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="h_1b">Check if there is a will</h3>

        <details>
          <summary>Yes, there is a will with a named executor</summary>
          <p>If you are the executor of a will, you are the legal representative of the person who died and responsible for the adminstration of the estate. In some cases, a court document may also be issued appointing an executor.</p>
          <p>You will need to provide a copy of the will or court document to the CRA to show that you are the legal representative.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>No, there is not a will or a named executor</summary>
          <p>If a person dies without a will (intestate), or an executor has not been named in a will, certain individuals can apply to adminster the estate. Check with <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/estate-planning/resources-estate-law.html">estate law of provincial or terriortial government</a> of the residence of the person who died for more information.</p>
          <p>If there is no court-appointed representive or you are waiting for an appointment, you can request to be appointed as a representative for CRA matters using form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc552.html">RC552 Appointing a Representative for a Deceased Person</a>. </p>
          <p>Once your request has been approved, you will be authorized as a representative who can view, get information about and update the tax information for the person who died. This approval is for CRA purposes only and not for other adminstrative responsibilities outside the CRA.</p>
        </details>

        <h2 id="h_2">Responsibilities of the legal representative</h2>
        <p>The legal representative is responsible for doing the taxes of the person who died and making sure any balance owing is paid before distributing the estate.</p>

        <p>As the legal representative, you need to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>make sure <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/notify-government-death.html">the CRA has been notified of the death</a></li>
          <li><a href="#h_3">confirm you are the legal representative with the CRA</a></li>
          <li>provide the CRA with any requested documentation
            <ul>
              <li>make sure tax returns are filed for the person who died:
                <ul>
                  <li>any <a href="prepare-returns-someone-died.html">returns for the year the person died</a></li>

              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>confirm the estate resolved all outstanding balances owing to the CRA</li>
            <li><a href="clearance-certificate.html">apply for a clearance certificate</a>, as needed, before distributing any assets of the estate
              <ul>
                <li>the legal representative can be held personally liable for outstanding tax balances owing, if assets have been distributed without getting a clearance certificate</li>
                <li>if the <a href="manage-estate-debt.html">estate cannot pay its debts</a>, a clearance certificate is not needed</li>
              </ul>

        </ul>

        <p>The social insurance number (SIN) of the person who died must be provided with any request or documents you are sending to the CRA.</p>
        <p>If the person who died was a resident of Québec, you may have additional responsibilities with Revenu Québec.
