          <p><strong>Note: Line 25300 was line 253 before tax year 2019.</strong></p>
          <p>Generally, if you had an <strong>allowable </strong>capital loss in a year, you have to apply it against your taxable capital gain for that year. If you still have a loss, it becomes part of the computation of your <strong>net </strong>capital loss for the year. You can use a net capital loss to reduce your taxable capital gains in any of the 3 preceding years or in any future year.</p>
          <p>You can apply your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-12700-capital-gains/definitions-capital-gains.html#Netcapitalloss">net capital losses</a> of other years to your taxable capital gains in 2021. Your available losses are shown on your notice of assessment or reassessment for 2020. Your notice will show your prior-year losses and your current year loss <strong>after adjustment</strong>. You only have to add those 2 amounts to calculate your total net capital loss available for 2021.</p>
          <p>To use net capital losses of <span class="nowrap">prior years</span> to reduce current year taxable capital gains, claim a deduction on <span class="nowrap"><strong>line 25300 </strong></span>of your income tax and benefit return. To carry a current year net capital loss back to 2018, 2019, or 2020, complete <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1a.html"><span class="nowrap">Form T1A</span>, Request for Loss Carryback</a>, and include it with your 2021 income tax and benefit return. Do not file amended returns for any of the years to which you want to apply a portion of the loss.</p>
          <p>The amount that you can claim depends on when you incurred the loss. This is because the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-12700-capital-gains/definitions-capital-gains.html#InclusionrateIR">inclusion rates</a> used to determine the taxable capital gains and allowable capital losses have changed over the years.</p>
          <p>There are 2 charts that can be used to determine your unapplied net capital losses available to apply to 2021. See the <strong>Completing your tax return</strong> area below to determine which chart you should use.</p>
