        <h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Manage an estate in debt</h1>

        <p>If the estate of someone who died has more debts than assets, there might be situations where the estate cannot finish paying tax debts or other debts, and the estate will not be distributed to beneficiaries.</p>

        <h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#h_1">File final tax returns</a></li>
          <li><a href="#h_2">Do not distribute any assets</a></li>
          <li><a href="#h_3">Pay as much as you can of the balance owing</a></li>
          <li><a href="#h_4">Leave the estate open and keep records of the estate</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="h_1">File final tax returns</h2>
        <p>Even if you know the estate of the person who died will not be able to pay any amount owing to the CRA, the representative will still have to <a href="prepare-returns-someone-died.html">prepare and file final return</a> for the person who died.</p>
        <p>If a trust account is created, you need to file a T3 return every year, regardless if there is income to be reported or not.</p>

        <h2 id="h_2">Do not distribute any assets</h2>
        <p>If the representative distributes any assets of the estate of the person who has died and there are any amounts owing to the CRA, you are personally liable for unpaid amounts.</p>

        <p>Because you are not distributing assets, you don’t need a clearance certificate.</p>

        <h3>Plans with specified beneficiaries</h3>
        <p>Some plans, such as for life insurance or registered plans (such as RRSPs) might have specified beneficiaries and will be paid directly to the beneficiary.</p>
        <p>In the case a payment is made directly to the beneficiary, it is not part of the estate, nor liable for debts of the estate. Consult with the insurance company or financial institution on the terms of each plan.</p>

        <h2 id="h_3">  Pay as much as you can of the balance owing</h2>
        <p>You must <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments-cra/individual-payments/make-payment.html">pay the balances owing to the CRA</a> as you can, up to the value of the estate. The legal representative and other beneficiaries are not personally liable for the estate’s debts to the CRA unless the estate’s assets are distributed before debts are paid.</p>

        <p>Debts to creditors other than the CRA should be consulted according to the relevant provincial or third party authority. Generally, you can pay debts to your funeral and testamentary expenses before you pay debts to the CRA. Tax debts have priority over unsecured creditors, such as credit card debt. </p>

        <h2 id="h_4">Leave the estate open and keep records of the estate</h2>
        <p>If the estate can not resolve all debts, you will not be able to apply for a clearance certificate or distribute assets.</p>

        <p>The estate will remain on file with the CRA, while you should keep all your records of the estate on file. In the event that the estate receives income in future tax years, you must <a href="prepare-returns-someone-died/report-assets.html">report the income on an optional return for rights or things or a T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return</a> and continue to repay any liabilities before making distributions.</p>
<p>Generally, there is no further action required on the part of the legal representative after filing the return and paying balances owing up to the value of the estate.</p>
