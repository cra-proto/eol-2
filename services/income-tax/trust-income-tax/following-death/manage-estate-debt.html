        <p>If the estate of someone who died has more debts than assets, there might be situations where the estate cannot finish paying a balance owing or other debts, and the estate will not be distributed to beneficiaries.</p>

        <h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#h_1">File final tax returns</a></li>
          <li><a href="#h_2">Do not distribute any assets</a></li>
          <li><a href="#h_3">Pay as much as you can of the balance owing</a></li>
          <li><a href="#h_4">Leave the estate open and keep records of the estate</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="h_1">File final tax returns</h2>
        <p>Even if you know there are not enough assests to pay a balance owing to the CRA, the representative will still have to <a href="prepare-returns-someone-died.html">prepare and file tax returns</a> for the person who died.</p>
        <p>If a trust account is created, you need to file a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/t3-return.html">T3 Trust Income Tax and Information return</a> every year, regardless if there is income to be reported or not.</p>

        <h2 id="h_2">Do not distribute any assets</h2>
        <p>Because the estate does not have assets to distribute, you cannot get a clearance certificate.</p>
       
         <h3>If you already distributed assets</h3>
         <details>
           <summary>Distributed assets <strong>without</strong> a clearance certificate</summary>
           <p>If the representative distributes any assets of the estate of the person who has died and there is a balance owing to the CRA, you are personally liable for unpaid amounts.</p>
         </details>
         <details>
            <summary>Distributed assets <strong>with</strong> a clearance certificate</summary>
            <p>If you previously got a clearance certificate and distributed an estate, but more debts came to light afterwards, refer to <a href="clearance-certificate.html#h_7">After you receive a clearance certificate</a>.</p>
         </details>
        
        <h3>Plans with specified beneficiaries</h3>
        <p>Some plans, such as for life insurance or registered plans (such as RRSPs) might have specified beneficiaries and will be paid directly to the beneficiary.</p>
        <p>In the case a payment is made directly to the beneficiary, it is not part of the estate, nor liable for debts of the estate. Consult with the insurance company or financial institution on the terms of each plan.</p>

        <h2 id="h_3">  Pay as much as you can of the balance owing</h2>
        <p>You must <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments-cra/individual-payments/make-payment.html">pay the balance owing to the CRA</a> as you can, up to the value of the estate.</p> <!-- The legal representative and other beneficiaries are not personally liable for the estate’s debts to the CRA unless the estate’s assets are distributed before debts are paid.-->

        <p>Debts to creditors other than the CRA should be consulted according to the relevant provincial or third party authority. Generally, you can pay debts to your funeral and testamentary expenses before you pay debts to the CRA. Tax debts have priority over unsecured creditors, such as credit card debt. </p>

        <h2 id="h_4">Leave the estate open and keep records of the estate</h2>
        <p>If the estate can not resolve all debts, you will not be able to apply for a clearance certificate or distribute assets.</p>

        <p>The estate will remain on file with the CRA and you should keep all your records of the estate on file.</p>
        <p>In the event that the estate receives income in future tax years, you must report the income on a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/t3-return.html">T3 Trust Income Tax and Information return</a> and continue to repay any liabilities before making distributions.</p>
        <p>Generally, there is no further action required on the part of the legal representative after filing the return and letting the CRA know a balance owing is unable to be paid.</p>
